  "description": "HOW IT WORKSAutomates daily project monitoring by fetching project data, analyzing tasks andteam capacity with anthropic models, and generating resource optimizationrecommendations. Target audience: project managers, engineering leads, andresource planners managing complex team assignments. Problem solved: manualcapacity planning misses bottlenecks; AI analysis identifies effort mismatchesand delays proactively. Workflow runs daily checks, merges project and teamprofiles, analyzes tasks via multiple anthropic agents (breakdown, estimation,assignment), calculates effort allocation, detects delays, generates rebalancingrecommendations, notifies stakeholders, and tracks milestones.SETUP STEPS 1. Configure daily trigger schedule. 2. Connect project management system APIs. 3. Set anthropic API keys with task analysis prompts. 4. Enable email notifications for managers. 5. Connect reporting database for tracking.PREREQUISITESAnthropic API access, project management tool credentials, team capacitydatabaseUSE CASESSaaS teams managing feature backlogs, consulting firms balancing client projectsCUSTOMIZATIONAdjust effort estimation models. Add Slack notifications for urgency.BENEFITSDetects delays 2-3 weeks early, improves team utilization by 25%",
